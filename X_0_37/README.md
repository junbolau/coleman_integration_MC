This folder contains the calculation of tiny integrals on the modular curve X_0(37) in Example 4.1.1.

- ```modpoly3.txt``` contains the coefficients of the modular polynomial at p=3. This is obtained from Drew Sutherland's database of modular polynomials.
- ```tiny_integrals.ipynb``` contains the calculations of tiny integrals.
