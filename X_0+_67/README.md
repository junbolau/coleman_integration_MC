sage code for computing coleman integrals on X_0+(67)
the "model free 67+ 3 (R,e0).ipynb" demonstrates the method in our paper, up to the computation of taylor expansions
and the correctness of the resutls are verified by matching it with the results computed from model "tiny integrals at point R, p=13.ipynb"
the sum of tiny integrals are computed with our method using model, even though same results can be given by the model-free code with longer runtime
